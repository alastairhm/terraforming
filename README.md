# terraforming

## Vagrant setup for Terraform and AWS

All the tools need to run Terraform and AWS-CLI are installed using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/).

Edit the `adfs/tools-versions` file to control the packages and versions installed.

You will need to copy in or setup your AWS configuration, SSH keys etc after bootup.

The command `aws-okta add` will and run the setup for the aws-okta CLI tool.
